# Workflow Architecture

**Purpose:** Core structural patterns for BMAD workflows.

## Structure

```
workflow-folder/
├── workflow.md              # Entry point, configuration
├── steps-c/                 # Create flow steps
│   ├── step-01-init.md
│   ├── step-02-[name].md
│   └── step-N-[name].md
├── steps-e/                 # Edit flow (if needed)
├── steps-v/                 # Validate flow (if needed)
├── data/                    # Shared reference files
└── templates/               # Output templates (if needed)
```

## workflow.md File Standards

**CRITICAL:** The workflow.md file MUST be lean. It is the entry point and should NOT contain:

- ❌ **Listing of all steps** - This defeats progressive disclosure
- ❌ **Detailed descriptions of what each step does** - Steps are self-documenting
- ❌ **Validation checklists** - These belong in steps-v/, not workflow.md
- ❌ **Implementation details** - These belong in step files

**The workflow.md SHOULD contain:**
- ✅ Frontmatter: name, description, web_bundle
- ✅ Goal: What the workflow accomplishes
- ✅ Role: Who the AI embodies when running this workflow
- ✅ Meta-context: Background about the architecture (if demonstrating a pattern)
- ✅ Core architecture principles (step-file design, JIT loading, etc.)
- ✅ Initialization/routing: How to start and which step to load first

**Progressive Disclosure Rule:**
Users should ONLY know about the current step they're executing. The workflow.md routes to the first step, and each step routes to the next. No step lists in workflow.md!

## Core Principles

### 1. Micro-File Design
- Each step is a focused file (~80-200 lines)
- One concept per step
- Self-contained instructions

### 2. Just-In-Time Loading
- Only current step file is in memory
- Never load future steps until user selects 'C'
- Progressive disclosure - LLM stays focused

### 3. Sequential Enforcement
- Steps execute in order
- No skipping, no optimization
- Each step completes before next loads

### 4. State Tracking
For continuable workflows:
```yaml
stepsCompleted: ['step-01-init', 'step-02-gather', 'step-03-design']
lastStep: 'step-03-design'
lastContinued: '2025-01-02'
```

Each step appends its name to `stepsCompleted` before loading next.

## Execution Flow

### Fresh Start
```
workflow.md → step-01-init.md → step-02-[name].md → ... → step-N-final.md
```

### Continuation (Resumed)
```
workflow.md → step-01-init.md (detects existing) → step-01b-continue.md → [appropriate next step]
```

---

## Frontmatter Variables

### Standard (All Workflows)
```yaml
workflow_path: '{project-root}/team/[module]/workflows/[name]'
thisStepFile: './step-[N]-[name].md'
nextStepFile: './step-[N+1]-[name].md'
outputFile: '{output_folder}/[output].md'
```

### Module-Specific
```yaml
# BMB example:
bmb_creations_output_folder: '{project-root}/team/bmb-creations'
```

### Critical Rules
- ONLY variables used in step body go in frontmatter
- All file references use `{variable}` format
- Paths within workflow folder are relative

---

## Menu Pattern

```markdown
### N. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select:** [A] [action] [P] [action] [C] Continue"

#### Menu Handling Logic:
- IF A: Execute {task}, then redisplay menu
- IF P: Execute {task}, then redisplay menu
- IF C: Save to {outputFile}, update frontmatter, then load {nextStepFile}
- IF Any other: help user, then redisplay menu

#### EXECUTION RULES:
- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input
- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'
```

**A/P not needed in:** Step 1 (init), validation sequences, simple data gathering

---

## Output Pattern

Every step writes to a document BEFORE loading next step:

1. **Plan-then-build:** Steps append to plan.md → build step consumes plan
2. **Direct-to-final:** Steps append directly to final document

See: `output-format-standards.md`

---

## Critical Rules

- 🛑 NEVER load multiple step files simultaneously
- 📖 ALWAYS read entire step file before execution
- 🚫 NEVER skip steps or optimize the sequence
- 💾 ALWAYS update frontmatter when step completes
- ⏸️ ALWAYS halt at menus and wait for input
- 📋 NEVER create mental todos from future steps
